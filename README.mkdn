# `udpecho` tool

This is a very simple tool for testing UDP echo services. I wrote this when the
existing tools in my package manager had a hard time with IPv6.

Usage:

```
# pinging an IPv6 UDP echo service on port 7
cargo run '[fe80::4:6ff:fe08:a0c]:7'
# same but with an interface specifier for link-local addrs
cargo run '[fe80::4:6ff:fe08:a0c%3]:7'
```
